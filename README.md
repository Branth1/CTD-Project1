## Description

This is a study of the variances in ocean conditions at 7 different locations during winter and summer. The data has been collected using CTD sensors and is available from the site listed below.

The comparisons to be made will be the changes in SSP during different seasons on approximately the same day as well as the changes over different times of day. The location of these tests and the impact it has on the results will also be taken into account.

It should be noted that although it is ideal to have all data collected on the same day, for some devices this was not possible.

## Background

**The questions we are looking to solve are as follows:**

        1-Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs the deep profiler.

        2-Where is the maximum value of SSP in each season?

        3-Compare the SSP profile in day vs night

        4-Compare the SSP profile in Summer vs Winter

        5-Compare the SSP profiles of all profilers recorded at same day in summer and winter.

**The devices and dates for recording are as follows:**
